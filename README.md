AirgeardBankingProject2

- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

   For the Airgead Banking Project 2, we were asked to create a program with C++ that would allow the user to model the amount of interest earned over a selected span of years. The user would be shown two reports, one without additional monthly deposits and one with additional monthly deposits.

- What did you do particularly well?

  I believe that I did well with the amount of comments and explanations in the program.

- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  My code could have been enhanced by using more classes. This would allow my code to be easier to read, better organization, makes it easier when having multiple people developing portions of the code, and just overall more efficient.

- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

  The piece of the code that was most challenging for me to write was the portion that calculated the compound interest. When writing it, I kept making simple mistakes which in turn added to my confusion. I overcame this obstacle by writing out how the compound interest was being calculated on paper, so it was easier for me to visualize. Once I did this, I was able to break the code down into smaller pieces so I could do small sections and test as I was creating it. 

- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

  There are multiple skills from this project that will be transferable to other projects. One is the skill of troubleshooting your code. As I made little mistakes here and there, I was going back and revisiting my code to determine where the issue was. While doing this, I was starting to recognize what the issues were faster and in the end I was catching the issues as I was writing the program. Another is the skill of comments. This was one of the larger programs I have created and as I was writing the code, I was making sure I put comments in that described what each class, function, command, etc. did. This will help anyone coming in behind me understand how the program is working.

- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  The use of comments is a great asset to maintenance and making it easier to read/understand. When someone comes in behind me to do maintenance on the program, they will have clear comments showing what each section is doing, they wonâ€™t have to try and determine what the code is doing. The use of multiple methods makes reusing code easier without having to type it in multiple times. If something changes with the method, it will only have to be changed in one location instead of multiple locations.
